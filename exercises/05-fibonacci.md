# Fibonacci Sequence

The [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a numerical sequence
where each number is equal to the sum of the previous two. It begins with 0, 1, and then continues
with 1 (1 + 0), 2 (1 + 1), 3 (2 + 1), 5 (3 + 2), etc.
So the beginning of the sequence is `[0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...]`

## Exercise

Create a function `fib(n)`, which takes a positive number n and returns a list of the first `n`
fibonacci numbers.

## Examples

```
fib(3) => [0, 1, 1]
fib(9) => [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
fib(1) => [0]
fib(0) => []
```
