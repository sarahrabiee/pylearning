# Greeting!

Look in the file `02-greeting.py` and complete the function `hello()`.
If the input is "there", then the function should print "Hello yourself!".
If the input is some other name, then the function should print "Hello x!", where 'x' is the name
backwards.

## Examples

```
hello('there') => prints "Hello yourself!"
hello('sara') => prints "Hello aras!"
hello('ygoog') => prints "Hello googy!"
```
